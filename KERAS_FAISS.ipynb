        "FAISS plays a crucial role in handling the text extracted from PDFs. After extracting the text using OCR or similar methods, you convert this text into dense vector representations. FAISS is then used to index these vectors, enabling fast and efficient similarity searches. When you query the text, FAISS quickly retrieves the most relevant vectors based on the similarity to your query, making it an essential tool for managing and searching large volumes of text data.\n",

        "The all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is a compact, pre-trained model from the Sentence-Transformers library. It's designed for producing sentence embeddings, capturing the semantic meaning of sentences or texts. Despite its small size, it offers robust performance, making it ideal for applications where resources are limited. In this project, it's used to convert extracted text from PDFs into dense vector embeddings. These embeddings are then stored in a vector database (VectorDB), allowing the system to efficiently retrieve and display relevant text chunks based on user queries, enhancing search accuracy."
